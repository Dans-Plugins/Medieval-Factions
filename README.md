# What is this?
An open source minecraft plugin licensed under GPL3 for players to use to organize politically. Allows them to create/manage factions, declare/end wars, and claim/unclaim land. It also supports promoting/demoting players to and from officer positions as well as a power level system to decide land limits. Finally, it supports faction homes, alliances, locks and more.

# Notes
- Project building works with Java 8. It may work with other versions but I know that it works with Java 8.
- This project uses the IntelliJ plugin Minecraft Development and Maven to compile its code.
- Testing can be done by running a local spigot server with the compiled JAR in the plugins folder and checking the console.
