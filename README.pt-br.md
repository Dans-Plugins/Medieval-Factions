# Medieval Factions

## Portugese Brazilian Translation
This file still needs to be translated.

## Description
Medieval Factions is a system of mechanics that allows for the simulation of sovereign nations in Minecraft. Players can create nations, claim territory, engage in warfare or politics, write laws or hold dueling tournaments, and generally are able to attempt to recreate society somewhat.

## Server Software
This plugin was developed using the Spigot API. Users may run into trouble using it with other available server softwares like Paper.

## Installation
1) You can download the plugin from [this page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/medieval-factions-sovereign-nation-simulator.79941/updates).

2) Once downloaded, place the jar in the plugins folder of your server files.

3) Restart your server.

### Dynmap Integration
Dynmap has been integrated with this plugin. In order to be able to view claimed land on a dynamic map, download and install the plugin [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/).

### Looking to create an add-on plugin?
I recommend using [FactionsBridge](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsbridge.89716/) by [Retrix_Solutions](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/retrix_solutions.491191/). It would make your add-on plugin usable across a number of factions implementations.

Alternatively, you can use the External API, the documentation for which can be found [here](https://github.com/dmccoystephenson/Medieval-Factions/wiki/External-API-Documentation).

I created this plugin because I wanted to use the original [Factions](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factions.1900/) plugin for an upcoming server of mine, but it wasn't updated for the version of minecraft I was going to be using. I decided to take inspiration from the concept of factions - groups of players that can claim land - and create my own factions plugin.

The first release version, [v1.7](https://github.com/dmccoystephenson/Medieval-Factions/releases/tag/v1.7), was released on SpigotMC in June 2020 and looked much different than the plugin does today.

I am extremely grateful to those that have donated their time improving the project, one way or another. The plugin wouldn't be where it is today without the contributions of others.
